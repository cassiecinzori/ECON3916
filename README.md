# Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my repository for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**! This portfolio showcases my journey in bridging traditional economic theory with modern data science techniques.

## About Me

I'm an undergraduate economics student at Northeastern University with a focus on econometrics and data-driven decision making. I'm currently seeking opportunities in data analysis, economic consulting, and finance where I can apply rigorous economic thinking alongside cutting-edge analytical tools.

My goal is to bridge the gap between causal inference—understanding *why* things happen and predictive analytics—forecasting *what* will happen. I believe the intersection of these approaches is where economics becomes most powerful in solving real-world problems.

## About This Portfolio

This repository contains my coursework and lab assignments from ECON 3916, where I'm learning to extend foundational statistical concepts into scalable machine learning solutions.

**Course Philosophy: Concept Extension**  
Rather than treating statistics and machine learning as separate disciplines, this course takes a unified approach. We start with core econometric concepts (like OLS regression, hypothesis testing, and causal inference) and scale them using modern ML algorithms (like Lasso, Ridge, and ensemble methods). This "concept extension" framework helps me understand *when* and *why* to apply different techniques—not just *how*.

**What I'm Learning:**
- Causal inference techniques (fixed effects, IV estimation, difference-in-differences)
- Regularization methods for high-dimensional data
- Prediction vs. explanation tradeoffs
- Model selection and cross-validation strategies
- Translating economic questions into data science workflows
