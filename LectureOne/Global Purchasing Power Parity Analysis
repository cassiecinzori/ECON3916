# Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis

## Objective

This project applies the theory of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) to real-world data by testing the Law of One Price using The Economist's Big Mac Index, a widely recognized measure of currency valuation based on "burgernomics."

## Methodology

- **Data Collection & Processing**: Manually constructed a structured dataset from The Economist's 2015 Big Mac Index using Python dictionaries, capturing local Big Mac prices and official exchange rates across multiple countries.

- **Implied PPP Calculation**: Computed the implied exchange rate for each currency by dividing the local Big Mac price by the US Big Mac price, establishing a theoretical exchange rate if the Law of One Price held perfectly.

- **Currency Valuation Analysis**: Calculated the percentage over- or undervaluation of each currency by comparing the implied PPP exchange rate against the actual market exchange rate, identifying arbitrage opportunities and purchasing power discrepancies.

## Key Findings

**[Example - Replace with your actual findings]:**

The analysis revealed significant deviations from purchasing power parity across major currencies. The Norwegian Krone exhibited substantial overvaluation at approximately [X]% above its PPP-implied level, suggesting that Big Macs—and by extension, general goods—are considerably more expensive in Norway than economic theory would predict. Conversely, emerging market currencies such as [Currency Name] demonstrated undervaluation of [Y]%, indicating potential arbitrage opportunities and lower relative purchasing power. These findings underscore the limitations of the Law of One Price in the presence of non-tradable goods, transportation costs, and market inefficiencies.

## Economic Interpretation

While the Law of One Price provides a theoretical foundation for understanding exchange rates, this analysis demonstrates that real-world currency valuations reflect a complex interplay of factors beyond simple price arbitrage. Deviations from PPP can be attributed to differences in labor costs, regulatory environments, taxation policies, and local market conditions. The Big Mac Index, while simplified, serves as an accessible proxy for understanding these economic dynamics and identifying currencies that may be trading away from their fundamental values.
